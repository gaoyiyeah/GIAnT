# GIAnT - A Group Interaction Annotation Tool

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of the GIAnT tool, which enables an accurate and fast annotation/coding of group interactions supported by an automatic multichannel speaker activity detection (MSAD). In the case that all participants of the group interaction have used a headset or lapel microphone during the audio recordings, the GUI displays up to 8 audio tracks in parallel and segments the speaker turns. Every speaker turn can be adapted and annotated/coded by hand with a user-specific coding scheme.

## Prerequisites
### Using GIAnT (compiled)
- [Matlab runtime 2015b](https://de.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html)
- [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) (ffmpeg, ffplay and ffprobe). You may want to download the executable files if you are not familiar with compiling source code. 

### For editing and compiling the source code (optional)
- [Matlab 2015b](https://de.mathworks.com/) or higher
- [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)

## Getting Started
### Installation

- Install Matlab (runtime)
- Compile ffmpeg, ffplay and ffprobe and put the executables to the folder path ./bin/ffmpeg/.

### Compiling the Matlab source code (optional)
```
matlab ... .m
```
